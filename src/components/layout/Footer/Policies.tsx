				<p>Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

			<div className={styles.content}>
				<p>
					In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your
					data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We never
					sell your data.
				</p>
				<p>
					This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Helog.
				</p>
				<p>
					This policy applies to our handling of information about site
					visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users
					(in relation to their procurement of the services and management of
					their relationship with Helog). We refer collectively to these
					categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this policy does not cover information about a customer's end
					users that Helog receives from a customer, or otherwise processes on a
					customers behalf, in connection with the services provided by Helog to
					the customer pursuant to an applicable services agreement (including
					the content of messages of customer end users ("End User
					Communications")). Helog processes End User Communications under the
					instructions of the relevant customer, which is the "data controller"
					or "business" (or occupies a similar role as defined in applicable
					privacy laws), as described in the applicable services agreement
					between such customer and Helog. Helog's obligations as a "data
					processor" or "service provider" with respect to such information are
					defined in such services agreement and applicable data protection
					addendum and are not made part of this policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are a customer's end user and you have questions about how your
					information is collected and processed through the services, please
					contact the organization who has provided your information to us for
					more information.
				</p>
				<h2 id="what-we-collect-and-why">What we collect and why</h2>
				<p>
					Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what
					that means in practice:
				</p>
				<h3 id="identity-and-access">Identity and access</h3>
				<p>
					When you sign up for a Helog, we ask for identifying information such
					as your email address.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information from Single Sign On (SSO) authentication services. If you
					decide to register for an account (or access your account) through an
					authentication service (such as Google or Facebook as a Single Sign
					On, also known as a SSO) ("Authentication Service"), we may collect
					information from these third party services, consistent with your
					privacy settings in your account with the relevant Authentication
					Service.
				</p>
				<p>
					We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we
					won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your
					permission either.
				</p>
				<h3 id="product-interactions">Product interactions</h3>
				<p>
					We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or
					maintain in your Helog accounts. This is so you can use our products
					as intended, for example, to create blog in Helog. We keep this
					content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account,
					we'll delete the content immediately.
				</p>
				<h3 id="general-geolocation-data">General Geolocation data</h3>
				<p>
					For most of our products, we log the full IP address used to sign up a
					product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy
					signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for
					security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data
					for as long as your product account is active.
				</p>
				<h3 id="advertising-and-cookies">Advertising and Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. You can adjust
					cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in
					your browser settings, although our apps won't work and other aspects
					of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.
				</p>
				<h2 id="when-we-access-or-disclose-your-information">
					When we access or disclose your information
				</h2>
				<p>
					No Helog human looks at your content except for limited purposes with
					your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops an
					automated process from working and requires manual intervention to
					fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root
					cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your
						permission.{' '}
					</strong>
					If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a
					support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.{' '}
					</strong>
					Accessing a customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a
					measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of
					both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and we do
					our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If
					we discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we
					will take action as necessary, including notifying appropriate
					authorities where warranted.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, if Helog is acquired by or merges with another company — we
					don't plan on that, but if it happens — we'll notify you well before
					any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to
					a different privacy policy.
				</p>
				<h2 id="your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information">
					Your rights with respect to your information
				</h2>
				<p>
					At Helog, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers,
					regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:
				</p>
				<ul className={styles.list}>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right to Know</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to know what personal information is collected,
							used, shared. We outline both the categories and specific bits of
							data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy
							policy.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right of Access</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							This includes your right to access the personal information we
							gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the
							sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right to Correction</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to request correction of your personal
							information.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right to Erasure / "To Be Forgotten"</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations
							under applicable law, that your personal information be erased
							from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service
							providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent
							you from using Helog services because our applications may then no
							longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in
							closing your account.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right to Complain</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of
							your personal information with the appropriate supervisory
							authority.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right to Restrict Processing</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							This is your right to request restriction of how and why your
							personal information is used or processed, including opting out of
							sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never
							will sell your personal data.)
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right to Object</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why
							your personal information is processed.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that
							could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from
							being made solely based on automated processes. This right is
							limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any
							contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is
							based on your explicit consent.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className={styles.item}>
						<p>
							<strong>Right to Non-Discrimination</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our
							products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level
							of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy
							rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of
							your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your
					account information. Please note that certain information may be
					exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need
					to retain certain information in order to provide our services to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your
					identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a
					minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are
					requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name
					and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to
					respond to your requests. If you have questions about exercising these
					rights or need assistance, please contact us at{' '}
					<a className={styles.link} href="mailto:whitesgr03@gmail.com">
						whitesgr03@gmail.com
					</a>
					. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will need
					written consent with a signature from the account holder before
					proceeding.
				</p>
				<p>
					Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our
					decision to deny your request, if applicable. We will provide
					information about how to exercise that right in our response denying
					the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a
					supervisory authority.
				</p>
				<h2 id="how-we-secure-your-data">How we secure your data</h2>
				<p>
					All data is encrypted via{' '}
					<a
						className={styles.link}
						target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"
					>
						SSL/TLS
					</a>{' '}
					when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database
					backups are also encrypted. In addition, we go to great lengths to
					secure your data at rest.
				</p>
				<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-delete-content-in-your-product-accounts">
					What happens when you delete content in your product accounts
				</h2>
				<p>
					If you choose to trashed your account, your account and content will
					become immediately inaccessible and revoke Helog's access to your
					third party services information.
				</p>
				<h2 id="data-retention">Data retention</h2>
				<p>
					We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for
					which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain
					information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it
					and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it.
					We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply
					with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
					agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention
					periods for certain types of information.
				</p>
				<h2 id="changes-and-questions">Changes and questions</h2>
				<p>
					We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant
					regulations and reflect any new practices. If we make significant
					changes, we will refresh the date at the top of this page.
				</p>
